# JWT
usage of jsonwebtoken in node
After pull run below commands: 
npm install (will create node_modules folder locally with all dependencies installed)
npm run auth-server (from Terminal 1, exposed on port 3000)
npm run data-sever (from Terminal 2, exposed on port 4000)
Then use requests.rest file to test (install REST Client(Huachao Mao) extension in VSCODE to use .rest files)
Alternatively you can use Postman app to test endpoints also.
